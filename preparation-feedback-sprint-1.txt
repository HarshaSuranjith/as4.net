- What's our definition of 'Done'?
    - What's should the remaining work be set to when the PR is created?

- Not every task was clear enough to get started, even though we created them together;
    possibly because sometimes we to do some research beforehand and the description contained several questionmarks ('?').

- Maybe this sprint isn't a good reference of how a good sprint should be because you hadn't that much time?

- It was nice to work in a more task-based approach where every PR/branch was linked to a well-defined work item.
    This made it very clear to me what the progress was and on what I was working at the moment.
