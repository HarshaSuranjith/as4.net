# Pull Receive Agent

The following section describes what the **Pull Receive Agent** is and what's its responsibility is:

## Agent Responsibility

The **Pull Receive Agent** has the same responsibility as the (Push) **Receive Agent**: to receive `AS4Message`'s via the configured _Receiver_ from a sending MSH. Instead of receiving messages directly, the **Pull Receive Agent** polls the sender for available messages.

Since the **Pull Receive Agent** polls for available messages on the sending MSH, this agent takes control of when an AS4 Message is received instead of making sure that there's constantly a receive-endpoint available.
The **Pull Receive Agent** is useful in situations where the receiving MSH isn't always online or has a limited bandwith.

## Message Flow

The `AS4Message`'s that are received by the **Pull Receive Agent** are processed in exactly the same way as the (Push) **Receive Agent** would handle them. The **SignalMessage** that will be created to respond to the pulled **UserMessage** will always be sent in an async manner to the MSH Sender.
See the message flow section in the (Push) **Receive Agent** documentation for more information on how a received `AS4Message` is processed.

## Agent Trigger

The **Pull Receive Agent** initiates the receive process by sending a _PullRequest_ signal message to the sending MSH. When the sending MSH receives such a _PullRequest_, the sender responds with an `AS4Message` that contains a `UserMessage`.  
If the sending MSH does not have any `UserMessage`s available for the received `PullRequest`, the sender responds with a special `Error` message that indicates that there are no `UserMessage`s available.

The _PullRequest_ signal messages are sent by the **Pull Receive Agent** using an _Exponential Backoff_ algorithm:

- when the sending MSH responds with a _no messages available_ message, the _Receiver_ will wait a bit longer to poll for the next `AS4Message`.
- when the sending MSH responds with a `UserMessage`, the _Receiver_ will reset the polling interval and will immediately sent a new _PullRequest_.

> The minimum and maximum polling interval used in the _Exponential Backoff_ is configurable on the _Receiver_. See the **Configuration** below.

## Message Partition Channels

It is possible to specify that only certain `UserMessage`s may be received. This is done by specifying the **Message Partition Channel** or **MPC** to which the `UserMessage`s that are being polled for, must belong to.

The **MPC** that must be used is defined in the PMode that is configured on the _Receiver_ of the **Pull Receive Agent**. If no **MPC** is specified in the PMode, the default **MPC** (<span>http://docs.oasis-open.org/ebxml-msg/ebms/v3.0/ns/core/200704/defaultMPC</span>) will be used.

## Configuration

The **Pull Receive Agent** will need the `PullRequestReceiver` to send out _PullRequest_ signal messages. Multiple _Sending Processing Modes_ can be configured on this _Receiver_, each with a maximum and minimum time interval in which the _PullRequests_ will exponentially be send.

Following example shows how two different _Sending Processing Modes_ are configured on the _Receiver_:

```xml
<Receiver type="Eu.EDelivery.AS4.Receivers.PullRequestReceiver, ...">
    <Setting key="my-fast-send-pmode" tmin="0:00:01" tmax="0:00:25" />
    <Setting key="my-slow-send-pmode" tmin="0:00:10" tmax="1:00:00" />
</Receiver>
```

The settings on the _Receiver_ don't have a value but instead require three attributes:

- `key`: defines for which _Sending Processing Mode_ a _PullRequest_ should be created
- `tmin`: defines the start interval in the _Exponential Backoff_. In each interval, a _PullRequest_ will be send. The interval will exponentially increase for non-_UserMessages_ responses.
- `tmax`: defines the maximum interval in the _Exponential Backoff_. The interval between each send operation of _PullRequests_ will not be greater than this interval.
