# Sending/Receiving Processing Mode

The <span>AS4.NET</span> MSH component uses PModes (Processing Modes) files to configure sending and receiving operations.
These PModes are actually series of settings that can be turend on and off accordingly to your needs (compression, signing, encryption, notification, delivery, ...).

This section consists of the contracts of both PModes to explain what's required or optional to have a valid and complete Sending/Receiving PMode.

- [Sending PMode](sending-pmode.md)
- [Receiving PMode](receiving-pmode.md)

> Note that there's examples of both PModes in the `./samples/pmodes` folder.
