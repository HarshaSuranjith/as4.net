# Sending/Receiving Processing Mode

The <span>AS4.NET</span> MSH component uses PModes (Processing Modes) files to configure sending and receiving operations.
These PModes are actually a series of settings that can be configured to meet your requirements (compression, signing, encryption, notification, delivery, ...).

This section explains the settings that can be set in Sending and Receiving PModes.

- [Sending PMode](sending-pmode.md)
- [Receiving PMode](receiving-pmode.md)

> Note that there are examples of both PModes in the `./samples/pmodes` folder.
