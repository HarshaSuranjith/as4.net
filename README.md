# AS4.NET
AS4.NET is an open-source application that implements the OASIS AS4 specification. It supports both the e-SENS e-Delivery and the EESSI AS4 Messaging profile as an ebMS endpoint.   
 
The component has been conformance tested against the e-SENS eDelivery specifications.  

AS4.NET is interoperable with multiple other AS4 gateway providers; AS4.NET has undergone performance and interop-tests against Holodeck B2B, RSSBus, Domibus, Flame Message Server and IBM B2B.

Basic testing against the EESSI AS4 Messaging profile is already covered. Extensive testing is scheduled later this year.
